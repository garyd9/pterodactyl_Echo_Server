# Echo Server in Pterodactyl

This Guide will help you set up Echo Servers on Linux with Pterodactyl with error handling.

Please use the same paths as I do in this guide. If you dont, stuff might now work as expected.

You also should have a Domain for the Pterodactyl Dashboard to be able to use SSL/https.
You might be able to do it without, but this Guide will work with a Domain.


I use Debian 12 x86. Other systems should work, but in this Guide I will only show how to get it to run on Debian 12.

For some of the steps, you have to follow the official Guide.
It doesnt make sense for me to just repeat everything here.
I will provide some additional imformations for some of the steps if needed. So check below for that.

This is the Guide I will work with. Just follow the steps below and I will tell you whenever you have to reference the guide.
```
https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html
```

Before you start you should update your system
```
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

# Install Docker:
```
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
```

# Dependencies Install:

We need to install the dependencies now. The official Guide works with Ubuntu, so I provide you how to set it up on Debian.
Please check the php Version on the official Guide! 

```
apt install -y curl gnupg lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates
wget -qO - https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/sury-php.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sury-php.gpg] https://packages.sury.org/php bookworm main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sury-php.list
apt update
curl -LsS https://r.mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash
apt update
#Check for the right php version on the official Guide!
sudo apt install -y php8.3 php8.3-{common,cli,gd,mysql,mbstring,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip} mariadb-server nginx tar unzip git redis-server bc
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer


```
Please continue on the "Download Files" Section of the official Guide and **come back for the "Webserver Configuration" Section!** 
For the Application URL when setting up "php artisan p:environment:setup", you should use a Domain with https. You dont have to, but you really should. If you only have a IP, use http://IP

I didnt set up "php artisan p:environment:mail", as I dont need it.

# Webserver Configuration

If you dont have a Domain, you cant use SSL. So just follow the official Webserver Configuration Section without doing the steps here.

- Setup your DNS Server and add a subdomain that is pointing to your servers IP.
  As an example: dash.example.com
```
apt install -y certbot
systemctl stop nginx
certbot certonly
```
- Select 1: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
- Enter your details
```
systemctl start nginx

```

- Now continue with the "Webserver Configuration" Section of the official Guide.

- If you start the "Installing Wings" Section, you dont need to install Docker! We did that already.

Also some Stuff for the "Installing Wings/Configure" Section of the official Guide:
- It will ask you to create a Location at some point. Do that and click sgain on Nodes -> Create New
- For Total Memory, Memory Over-Allocation, Total Disk Space, Disk Over-Allocation I entered 8000/100%. But less or more should work fine.
- For the Allocation, enter your Servers IP-Address and enter Ports: 6792-6802. This will give you 10 possible Server instances. Dont forget to click Submit!
- Dont forget the Auto-Deploy!!!

**Now we are done with the basic Pterodactyl Installation**

# Clone this Repo:
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/BL00DY-C0D3/pterodactyl_Echo_Server.git
cd pterodactyl_Echo_Server
```

# Run the getBinaries.sh to get the Echo Binaries
If you choose different ports then the defaults 6792-6802, add the following to /opt/pterodactyl_Echo_Server/files/exclude.list **AFTER YOU STARTED THE SCRIPT BELOW ONCE**

```
netconfig*
```
Run
```
bash getBinaries.sh
```

# Configure Echo configs

- config.json:
```
nano /opt/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena/_local/config.json
```

This is an example config.json. If you dont know what to enter here, contact your Matchmaking Admin!
```
{
    "apiservice_host":  "http://g.example.com:80/api",
    "configservice_host":  "ws://g.example.com:80/config",
    "loginservice_host":  "ws://g.example.com:80/login?discordid=<YOUR DISCORD ID>&password=<YOUR PASSWORD>",
    "matchingservice_host":  "ws://g.example.com:80/matching",
    "serverdb_host":  "ws://g.example.com:80/serverdb?discordid=<YOUR DISCORD ID>&password=<YOUR PASSWORD>&regions=default,<YOUR REGION CODE>",
    "transactionservice_host":  "ws://g.example.com:80/transaction",
    "publisher_lock":  "echovrce"
}
```
Type CTRL+X, then y, then Enter to save

- start-echo.sh:
```
nano ./scripts/start-echo.sh 
```

Change the region variable to match your region


# Open your Pterodactyl dashboard to setup the server

# Prepare mounts

- Go back into your Terminal

```
nano /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml
```
- On the allowed_mounts section enter the path like this:

```
allowed_mounts:
- /opt/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena
- /opt/pterodactyl_Echo_Server/scripts
```




# Configure the mounts in your Dashboard
- Go to Mounts -> Create New
  - Name: ``ready-at-dawn-echo-arena``
  - Source: ``/opt/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena``
  - Target: ``/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena``
  - Click Create
  - Eggs: Choose your created Egg (Probably at the bottom of the list)
  - Nodes: Choose your Node
  - Click on Save

- Do the same again with different Name, Source, Target
  - Name: ``scripts``
  - Source: ``/opt/pterodactyl_Echo_Server/scripts``
  - Target: ``/scripts``
 
- Its probably the best if you reboot your server now (I had problems with the Mounts without rebooting): ``reboot 0``



# Finally we can create the server instances (Do this for as many servers as you want)
- Go to Servers -> Create New
  - Server Name: Enter a Name. (I would include the Port you choose at "Default Allocation" in it. Like Echo_6792)
  - Server Owner: Enter your previously created user
  - UNCLICK "Start Server when Installed"
  - Node: Choose your Node
  - Default Allocation: Choose a Port
  - Memory/Disk Space: Enter 0 or whatever you want
  - CPU Limit/CPU Pinning is a really nice Setting, but you dont really need to set it
  - Nest : Choose your created Nest
  - Egg/Docker Image should be set already
  - Click on Create Server
  - It will take a minute for the server to be installed. Just wait a minute and reload the page until you have the Mounts Tab
  - Click on Mounts
  - Press the + on both configured Mounts




# WE ARE PRETTY MUCH DONE!


You can no close out of the Admin Area (the button top right) and click on one of your created servers

- Click start
  - The first start will probably error out. But you dont have to do anything, as my error-check.sh script will automatically restart.
 
# You also should enable the Log Cleanup Script:

Type ``crontab -e``
Add:

```
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/bash /opt/pterodactyl_Echo_Server/scripts/move_logs.sh
```

# Optionally, delete old log files.  In the crontab entry below, replace 30 with the number of days you want to keep older logs:

Type ``crontab -e``
Add:

```
5 11 * * * find /opt/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena/logs/archive -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```
